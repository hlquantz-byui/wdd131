            <article id="core-mechanics">
              <h3>Core Mechanics</h3>
              <p>The game primarily uses a d20 for most checks and d100 (percentage rolls) for certain outcomes. Standard RPG dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12) are used for attack damage and specific abilities.</p>

              <h3>Experience & Tier Progression</h3>
              <p>Characters progress through three tiers—Novice, Adept, and Master—by accumulating experience points (XP). The XP required for each tier increases logarithmically, pushing players to face more powerful foes as they grow in strength.</p>

              <h3>Fate Points</h3>

              <p>Magic is fueled by <strong>Aether Points (AP)</strong>. Spells have varying AP costs, allowing players to mix and match them. Running out of Aether Points can cause exhaustion, while high-level characters can use more than their AP limit at a risk of overdraw.</p>

            <!-- Exhaustion System -->
            <article id="exhaustion">
              <h3>Exhaustion</h3>
              <p>Running out of Aether Points results in levels of exhaustion. Each level reduces a character's abilities until they rest or recover.</p>
              <h4>Exhaustion Levels</h4>
                <p>There are five levels of exhaustion. Each level adds more severe penalties to the character's capabilities:</p>
                <ol>
                <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> Disadvantage on all checks involving Might, Agility, and Endurance.</li>
                <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> Movement speed is halved, and all attack rolls have disadvantage.</li>
                <li><strong>Level 3:</strong> Characters can only take one action per turn, regardless of abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Level 4:</strong> All skill and saving throws are made with disadvantage.</li>
                <li><strong>Level 5:</strong> The character falls unconscious.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Recovering from Exhaustion</h4>
                <p>Recovering from exhaustion requires rest and proper care:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Short Rest:</strong> Restores one level of exhaustion.</li>
                <li><strong>Long Rest:</strong> Restores two levels of exhaustion. If the character is fully rested and well-fed, they can recover all levels of exhaustion.</li>
                <li><strong>Magical Remedies:</strong> Some high-level spells or potions may remove one or more levels of exhaustion.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Exhaustion from Aether Overdraw</h4>
                <p>When high-level characters attempt to cast spells beyond their Aether Points limit, they may suffer exhaustion as a result of overdraw. Each overdraw attempt increases the character's exhaustion level by one.</p>
